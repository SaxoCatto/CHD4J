"Brotherhood" competition from Codefun

Story goes like this: A player called "00xx" won a mind game, he tried a suicidal move to THV's spaceship with a Shitotsubakurai. Seeing that, 00yy, 00xx's fr
iend, is stressed and craves for a soda can. While being destressed, he had a flash of genius: Why don't we split the bomb mentioned into pieces and shoot?

It is easier said then done of course. Given the bomb is a line with N length, with "i"th part as boom power of A[i] (A[i] can be negative). We can cut the bomb 
to many parts, but it must retain some of its' original shape. For that, the cut bomb must have a new length longer than K.

Let's help 00yy in cutting a new bomb with maximum boom power.



Specs:

T as number of tests. \*Enters*\
N as length. (0 <--> 10^5) \*Enters*\ 
A[i]s. (0 <--> 10^9)

Gives length of desired bomb.
